# create webpages with Html 

### the Structure :
1. header ...> the title of tab for html pages , and it don't show in page .
2. title ...> show up in the browser .

3. body ...> 
4. section 
5. article 
6. main 
7. footer 

u get to building the page and the first step to that is preparing the HTML strucre 
a newibe would go for the good old (<head> <body> <footer>) and fill it out with the elements and the tags
but were training to be pros here so we have to go an extra step
we should devide the page in a more clean matter 
since the <body> is what the user sees it so most of the deviding will be deviding the body into <header> <main> <footer> 
this way its easier to navigate the code for us after a while and for other programmers who will open our code later

## the end
