# Computer Architecture and Logic

1. how computer work ? 
computer work with binary lang 0 & 1 , 0&1 is bit (the smal iformation in computer )
text , sound , and img conver to binary code , because computers just work with it . 

2. circuits & logic ?

computer need 4 steps for work : 
- input 
- storge 
- process
- output 

the main part in computers is (cpu)

input ... cpu ... logicgate... memory 


all output use bits to show : 
- pixel 
-sound 
etc.. 

0...> off 
1...> on 

### hardware & software : 
all of us can see the hardware , but can't  see software 

hardware & software work a both to do any process in computer .
