# Text editor

##### A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
##### your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
##### allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
##### to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
##### important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

### A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.


## The first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory.


### ex :
pwd


/home/ryan

## It's one thing to know where we are. Next we'll want to know what is there. The command for this task is ls. It's short for list. Let's give it a go.


### ex :

ls



bin Documents public_html


## In order to move around in the system we use a command called cd which stands for change directory. It works as follows:

cd [location]

### ex :



pwd


/home/ryan


cd Documents

ls

file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

...

cd /

pwd

/

ls

bin boot dev etc home lib var

...

cd ~/Documents

pwd

/home/ryan/Documents

cd ../../

pwd

/home

cd

pwd

/home/ryan
